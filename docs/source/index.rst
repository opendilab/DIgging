**DIgging** is a Decision Intelligence heuristic searching and optimization platform.
It provides easy-to-use searching algorithms such as **Genetic Algorithm**, **Bayesian Optimization** and
**Reinforcement Learning** etc. It can be used to handle combinatorial optimization problems and
non-gradient search problems.

**DIgging** is a fundamental platform under 
`OpenDILab <http://opendilab.org/>`_ and it uses 
`DI-engine <https://github.com/opendilab/DI-engine>`_ to build RL searching pipelines.
